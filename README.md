Challange2

What was the challange?
The challenge was to create two docker containers (flask-app and mysql) and configure. Mysql container should contain database with name flask-db with table users. Third task was to create nginx container with reverse proxy also updated our files with command.txt
 whick contains all commands I was used for this challenge


How I exected the challenge to go
During the challenge I expected to get task similar which we did during the week.


What went well?
I manage to create docker containers configure dockerfile, create database , I also set up env var with secret password which was later used in Dockerfile



What didn't go as planned?
linux froze while I was writting commands so I need to restart it and after I had problem because 
I had to redo some command. 

Possible improvements for future challanges
challenge task could be better described
